# elf-jump

Tried to make a jumping game for the kids, then it started getting out of control.

WEIRDLY using this static site builder instead of just webpack so I can import this easily elsewhere.

+ `npm i && npm run build`
+ `open dist/index.html // just the elf jump game`
+ `open dist/basket.html // just the basket game`
+ `open dist/emu.html // just the emu game`
+ `npm start && open http://localhost:3000/emu.html // multiplayer emu game`

The emu game runs a server on your machine that other players can connect to. Open port 3000 on this machine and share the ip address.
